Calories Tracker

The purpose of my application is to track calories consumed daily, weekly, and monthly. The problem my web application solves is that is helps people keep track of the calories that they are consuming. This helps people stay in charge of their health since their health is so important. This web application also helps people that are overweight manage their weight and help with their weight loss. They can track their calories, keep their calories at a calorie deficit and lose the weight.
